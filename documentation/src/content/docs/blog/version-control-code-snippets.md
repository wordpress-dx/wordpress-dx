title: Version Control Your WordPress Code Snippets

excerpt: Most WordPress developers manage their code snippets by editing them directly in the admin panel. Here's a better way, one that gives you full Git history and lets you deploy changes like any other codebase.
---

If you use the [Code Snippets plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/), you're probably editing your PHP functions directly in the admin panel. Click the snippet, make the change, save. Done.

It works. Until it doesn't.

Someone edits a snippet and breaks something. You don't know what changed. There's no history. You either remember what it looked like before, or you don't. There's no `git log`, no diff, no blame.

## How people try to solve this today

The current options aren't great.

**Option 1: WPCodeBox or Code Snippets Cloud**
These tools offer built-in versioning: you can see a history of changes and revert. It works, but it's locked inside their platform. Your code history lives in their database, not in your repo, and it doesn't integrate with your existing Git workflow.

**Option 2: Keeping snippets in your theme's `functions.php`**
This at least puts the code in a file you can version. But it ties snippets to your theme, means they disappear on theme switch, and turns `functions.php` into an unorganized dumping ground.

**Option 3: A custom plugin**
Some agencies build a site-specific plugin to hold all their custom code. This is better: it's version-controlled and theme-independent. But it requires setup for every project and doesn't give you a clean way to sync between environments.

None of these feel like a real developer workflow.

## The WDX approach

WDX treats your snippets as plain files in a Git repository. Pull them down from WordPress, edit them locally, push them back. Every change is a commit.

### Setup

Install the WDX CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @wordpress-dx/cli
```

Configure your site:

```bash
wdx site config
# Enter your WordPress URL, username, and application password
```

### Pull your snippets

```bash
wdx snippets pull
```

This creates a `snippets/` directory with one `.php` file per snippet:

```
snippets/
  my-custom-function.php
  woocommerce-checkout-tweak.php
  disable-gutenberg.php
```

Each file is the raw PHP content of your snippet, nothing more.

### Edit locally

Open any file in your editor. Make changes. The feedback loop is your local environment, not the WordPress admin panel.

```bash
git add snippets/woocommerce-checkout-tweak.php
git commit -m "fix: apply discount code before tax calculation"
```

Now you have a commit. A diff. A message explaining why. This is reviewable, reversible, and shareable.

### Push back to WordPress

```bash
wdx snippets push
```

WDX syncs your local files back to WordPress via the REST API. No FTP, no copy-paste.

If you want to see what would change without actually changing anything:

```bash
wdx snippets push --dry-run
```

## Working across environments

The real value shows up when you're working with local, staging, and production environments. With WDX:

```bash
# Pull from production
wdx snippets pull --url https://production.example.com

# Test locally, commit changes

# Push to staging first
wdx snippets push --url https://staging.example.com

# When ready, push to production
wdx snippets push --url https://production.example.com
```

Your snippets flow between environments the same way your code does. No database exports, no manual copy-paste.

## One thing to keep in mind

WDX syncs snippets by name. If you rename a snippet in the admin panel, WDX will treat it as a new snippet on the next push. Keep names consistent, and treat the files as the source of truth once you're in this workflow.

If this resonates, the next step is setting up your application password in WordPress and adding `snippets/` to your project's Git repository. From there, every snippet change is a commit.
